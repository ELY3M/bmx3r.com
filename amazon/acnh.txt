Thank you for your order. Here are Delivery Instructions.

For Animal Crossing Items:

Load up your Animal Crossing Island.
Head over to your airport and talk with Orville.
Say "I want visitors."
Select "Via online play."
Accept the online terms agreement if shown.
Select "Roger!" to connect online.
Select "Invite via Dodo Code."
Select "The more the merrier!"
Select "Yeah, invite anyone."

You will then be provided with a 5 digit Dodo Code. You will need to send this Dodo code to me in a private message. Do not share it with anyone else.
if possible, keep your switch on and online till I get to your dode code and make delivery of the items to your island.  
Please keep your switch awake because the sleep mode will turn off internet and close the gates in the game.  
After I receive your Dodo Code I will shortly join your island with your purchased items for delivery.
