the companies who refuse to follow customer's shipping preferences.  

Based on my experience.  They choose USPS over my preferences for UPS or FedEx 

Amazon.com - They almost always use USPS.  They have contract with USPS.    
https://zazzle.com - They wont listen to me!  They shipped using USPS.  I wont go to them ever again - posted 1 star review.    
https://medicalsource.com/  - I choose UPS Ground and they shipped using USPS - I will post 1 star reviews all over.  I hope USPS will drop it on my front door since it is large package (diapers and spoons)     
https://www.ebay.com/str/computerupgradeking - I choose UPS Ground on my order and they shipped using USPS.  They totally ignored my messages.   FUCK THAT SELLER!!!   
any websites named "Computer Upgrade King"  



BIG FUCK YOU TO COMPANIES who do not follow customer's choices for shipping carriers. 
NOT EVERYONE can have USPS delivered to them.
