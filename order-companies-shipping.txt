the companies who refuse to follow customer's shipping preferences.  

Based on my experience.  They choose USPS over my preferences for UPS or FedEx 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon.com - They almost always use USPS.  They have contract with USPS.    
Aliexpress - They failed my test!!!  I choose UPS Ground for small order.  the seller used USPS shipping.  they do not respect my shipping choice at all!!!  FUCK THAT SITE!!!      
https://zazzle.com - They wont listen to me!  They shipped using USPS.  I wont go to them ever again - posted 1 star review.    
https://medicalsource.com/  - I choose UPS Ground and they shipped using USPS - I will post 1 star reviews all over.  I hope USPS will drop it on my front door since it is large package (diapers and spoons)     
https://www.ebay.com/str/computerupgradeking - I choose UPS Ground on my order and they shipped using USPS.  They totally ignored my messages.   FUCK THAT SELLER!!!   
any websites named "Computer Upgrade King"  


BIG FUCK YOU TO COMPANIES who do not follow customer's choices for shipping carriers. 
NOT EVERYONE can have USPS delivered to them.   


TESTING:  
https://www.saveritemedical.com/ 
adult wipes / diapers / 25GA 1in needles       
chosen UPS Ground  
They wanted to ship via fedex. I allowed them to. 
I am glad they communicated and asked me first!  




The Companies that I love and use USPS alternatives (UPS or FedEx) or follow buyer's choices.  


https://walmart.com - they use FedEx and UPS on my orders.  make sure you order items that are fulfilled by Walmart.   
https://gamestop.com - FedEx - the last order was transferred to USPS... How fuck I upgrade smartpost packages to regular fedex delivery???     
https://temu.com - make sure you do not order from "local" listings.  sellers will ship via USPS on those "local" listing.  longer wait thou.
