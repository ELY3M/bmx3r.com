the companies who refuse to follow customer's shipping preferences.  

Based on my experience.  They choose USPS over my preferences for UPS or FedEx  OR They wont let customers choose...    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon.com - They almost always use USPS.  They have contract with USPS.    
Aliexpress.com - They failed my test!!!  I choose UPS Ground for small order.  The seller used USPS shipping.  They do not respect my shipping choice at all!!!  FUCK THAT SITE!!!      
https://ebay.com - They do not enforce shipping my shipping choices to the sellers.  They should have enforce sellers to print UPS shipping labels.  I wont buy on ebay anymore unless seller message and agree to ship via UPS or FedEx.     
https://zazzle.com - They wont listen to me!  They shipped using USPS.  I wont go to them ever again - posted 1 star review.    
https://medicalsource.com/  - I choose UPS Ground and they shipped using USPS - I will post 1 star reviews all over.  I hope USPS will drop it on my front door since it is large package (diapers and spoons)     
https://www.ebay.com/str/computerupgradeking - I choose UPS Ground on my order and they shipped using USPS.  They totally ignored my messages.   FUCK THAT SELLER!!!   
any websites named "Computer Upgrade King"  
Third Party Sellers on walmart.com that do not have their items at walmart fulfillment warehouses. They are likely to use USPS.  
"local" listings on temu - They do not give you shipping choices :(       
http://www.orientaltrading.com/ - they chose USPS on my walmart order.    
https://reolink.com  - They used USPS!! STUPID FUCKERS!!!!  WHY THEY WOULD USE USPS ON EXPENSIVE ORDER.....   
https://gamestop.com - ordered a small thing (glow in the dark dices) - They choose USPS for this order!!!  --- They shipped it in big box and lucky USPS dropped it at my front door as I requested.         


Companies not to order: 
https://expressmed.com - Once the order is accepted by the carrier it is unknown until then, we use UPS, FedEx and USPS. We are not able to choose that carrier.

BIG FUCK YOU TO COMPANIES who do not follow customer's choices for shipping carriers or allow customers to choose. 
NOT EVERYONE can have USPS delivered to them.
